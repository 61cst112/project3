<H3> Flock of birds: </H3>

A flock of birds flies across the screen in "Vee" formation,
with each pair of birds 
slightly smaller,
following behind and farther apart
(one higher and one lower).
<P>
When the flock reaches one side of the screen (right or left),
reverse the direction of flight,
change then height to a random value,
and change the number of (pairs of) birds to a random number.
<BR>
Be sure to change the shape of the birds,
so that they face in the correct direction.

</TABLE>

<P>
As they fly, each bird should be "animated"
to flap its wing up or down, every second or so (30 frames). 


<H3> Waving grass: </H3>

At the bottom of the screen, draw some waving grass
(evenly-spaced lines)
that leans to the left or right 
following the direction of motion for one of the creatures
(hero, monster, sun, etc.)




<H3> Ladder with climbing monkey. </H3>

Add a vertical ladder,
somewhere on the screen,
with a "monkey" that can climb the ladder,
upward or downward.

<P>
When the "u" (or "d") key is clicked,
have the monkey go UP (or DOWN) one step of the ladder,
and change position of hands and feet
(to provide a two-step animation). 
In one position,
the monkey's right hand is reaching up and left leg is reaching down;
reverse these positions for the next step.
 



<H3> Add some buttons to control the action. </H3>

Add an "UP" button and a "DOWN" button.
When clicked, these buttons do the same thing as 
pressing the "u" or "d" key.

<P>
Add at least three more buttons,
such as "QUIT" or "RESET"
to do something to the screen, when clicked.

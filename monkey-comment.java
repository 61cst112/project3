/**  Project 3.
  Animated monkey climbs up and down a ladder.
  Flocks of birds fly across the screen from left to right.
 
  [BIRDS} button starts a new flock of birds flying across from left to right.
      Random height for the leader bird (from top of ladder to halfway down).
      Random number of birds in the flock (from two to seven) follow the leader.
      Each bird in the flock is slightly smaller the one ahead of it and flies lower.

  MONKEY:
    Whenever space bar is pressed, the monkey moves one step,
    changing position of arms & legs with each step up or down,
    changing direction at top or bottom of the ladder.
